## Project Overview
The **Generative AI Research Navigator** is designed to streamline the process of extracting and analyzing information from news articles. By leveraging technologies such as FAISS, LangChain, and OpenAI, this tool provides users with a sophisticated platform for conducting in-depth research and gaining valuable insights.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load and process data from multiple news article URLs.
- **Text Splitting**: Efficiently split the content into manageable chunks for analysis.
- **Embeddings and Vector Indexing**: Generate embeddings and create a FAISS vector index for efficient data retrieval.
- **Question Answering**: Retrieve answers to user queries based on the processed data.
- **Source Citation**: Provide sources for the retrieved answers, ensuring transparency and reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: For managing large language models and chains.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **OpenAI**: For generating text embeddings and processing queries.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive user interface.
- **Unstructured**: For loading and processing unstructured data from URLs.
- **Python Libraries**: Such as `dotenv`, `pickle`, and `faiss-cpu`.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdulghaffaransari/Generative-AI-Research-Navigator.git
   cd Generative-AI-Research-Navigator
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage
To use the Generative AI Research Navigator, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Enter URLs**:
   In the sidebar, enter up to three news article URLs you want to process.

3. **Process URLs**:
   Click the "Process URLs" button to start loading and processing the data.

4. **Ask Questions**:
   Enter your questions in the main input field to retrieve answers based on the processed data.

## Workflow
The workflow of the Generative AI Research Navigator is as follows:

1. **Load Data**:
   - Use `UnstructuredURLLoader` to load content from the provided URLs.
   - Display a progress message to keep users informed.

2. **Split Text**:
   - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the loaded data into manageable chunks.

3. **Create Embeddings**:
   - Generate embeddings for the text chunks using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.

4. **Build FAISS Index**:
   - Create a FAISS vector index from the document embeddings.
   - Save the index and related data to files for future use.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - Load the FAISS index and related data when a user enters a query.
   - Use `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to process the query and retrieve answers.
   - Display the answer and sources to the user.
